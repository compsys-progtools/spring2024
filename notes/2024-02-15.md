# How do programmers communicate about code?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{tip}
check if your codespace has uncommitted changes on [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)

note: 
- you can only have 2 active at a time(green dots)
- you can see if any have uncommitted changes
- you can [export those changes to a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/troubleshooting/exporting-changes-to-a-branch) from this page
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we are going to pick up from where we left off talking about the conventional commits. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

That is a core example of the types of detailed communication we do in programming that is embedded into the work. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Why Documentation

Today we will talk about documentation, there are several reasons this is important: 
- **using** official documentation is the best way to get better at the tools
- understanding how documentation is designed and built will help you use it better
- **writing** and  **maintaining** documentation is really important part of working on a team
- documentation building tools are a type of developer tool (and these are generally good software design)
  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Design is best learned from examples. Some of the best examples of software *design* come from developer tools. 

- [source (js version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
- [source (python version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In particular documentation tools are really good examples of: 
- pattern matching
- modularity and abstraction
- automation
- the build process beyond compiling




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

By the end of today's class you will be able to:
- describe different types of documentation
- find different information in a code repo
- generate documentation as html 
- ignore content from a repo
- create a repo locally and push to GitHub



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## What is documentation 

[documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1)

from [ethnography of docuemtnation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why is documentation so important?

we should probably spend more time on it

![differenc ein time spent vs should](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10606-018-9333-1/MediaObjects/10606_2018_9333_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

[source](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/most-developers-think-we-should-spend-more-time-documentation)




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## So, how do we do it? 

[Documenation Tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools)



[write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)

[linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/) and here is [why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Jupyterbook 

[Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) wraps sphinx and uses markdown instead of restructured text. The project authors [note in the documenation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) that it "can be thought of as an *opinionated distribution of Sphinx*". We're goign to use this. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

navigate to your  folder for this course (mine is `inclass/systems`)




```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can confirm that `jupyter-book` is installed by checking the version. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book --version
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
Jupyter Book      : 0.15.1
External ToC      : 0.3.1
MyST-Parser       : 0.18.1
MyST-NB           : 0.17.2
Sphinx Book Theme : 1.0.1
Jupyter-Cache     : 0.6.1
NbClient          : 0.5.13
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will run a command to create a jupyterbook from a template, the command has 3 parts: 
- `jupyter-book` is a program (the thing we installed)
- `create` is a subcommand (one action that program can do)
- `tiny-book` is an argument (a mandatory input to that action)

````{margin}
```{tip}
This is *structurally* similar to `git add .`

- `git` is a program
- `add` is a subcommand
- `.` is a path, and an argument
```
````

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================

```
We see that it succeeds

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can make it with any name, 
beacuse the name is an argument or input 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create example
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    example/

===============================================================================

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Each one makes a directory, we can see by listing

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```{code-block} console
example				tiny-book
gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And we can delete the second one since we do not actually want it. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm example/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
rm: example/: is a directory
```
we get an error because it is not well defined to delete a directory, and potentially risky, so `rm` is written to throw an error


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Instead, we have to tell it two additional things: 
- to delete recusively `r`
- to force it to do something risky with `f`
  
*note* we can stack single character options together with a single `-`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm -rf example/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Next we will go into the folder we mad and explore it some
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd tiny-book/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
.			intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
..			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Starting a git repo locally

We made this folder, but we have not used any git operations on it yet, it is actually not a git repo, which we *could* tell from the output above, but let's use git to inspect and get another hint. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can try `git status`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

This tells us the `.git` directory is missing form the current path and all parent directories. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To make it a git repo we use `git init` with the path we want to initialize, which currently is `.`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git init .
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/tiny-book/.git/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

Here we are faced with a social aspect of computing that is *also* a good reminder about how git actually works 

(nomaster)=
### Retiring racist language
Historically the default branch was called master.

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we'll change our default branch to main
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -m main
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and check in with git now

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml
	intro.md
	logo.png
	markdown-notebooks.md
	markdown.md
	notebooks.ipynb
	references.bib
	requirements.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

this time it works and we see a two important things:
- there are no previous commits
- all of the files are untracked

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


and we will commit the template so that we have it saved as a point we could go back to. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

We have to add separately because the files are **untracked** we cannot use the `-a` option on commit

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and then we will commit with a simple message

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'jupyter book template'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Structure of a Jupyter book

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will explore the output by looking at the files
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	references.bib
intro.md		markdown.md		requirements.txt
```


A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`), some for content, and some helpers that are common but not required. 

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)
- the `*.md` files are content
- the `.bib` file is bibiolography information
- The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{note}
the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


The table of contents file describe how to put the other files in order.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat _toc.yml 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
# Table of contents

The configuration file, tells jupyter-book basic iformation about the book, it provides all of the settings that jupyterbook and sphinx need to render the content as whatever output format we want.

### Dev tools mean we do not have to write bibliographies manually

bibliographies are generated with [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) which takes structured information from the references in a [bibtex file](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) with help from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For general reference, reference managers like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) can track all of your sources and output the references in bibtex format that you can use anywhere or sync with tools like MS Word or Google Docs. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The one last file tells us what dependencies we have

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat requirements.txt 
```

If your book generates with error messages run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```{admonition} Try it yourself

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can look at what it did
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
_build			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we note that this made a new folder called `_build`. we can look inside there. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls _build/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and in the html folder: 
```{code-cell} bash

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can also copy the path to the file and open it in our browser




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can change the size of a browswer window or use the screen size settings in inspect mode to see that this site is responsive. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We didn't have to write any html and we got a responsive site!




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


If you wanted to change the styling with sphinx you can use built in
[themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) which tell sphinx to put different
files in the `_static` folder when it builds your site, but you don't have to change any of your content!  If you like working on front end things (which is great! it's just not alwasy the goal) you can even
build [your own theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html) that can work with sphinx.



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Ignoring Built files

The built site files are compeltey redundant, content wise, to the original markdown files. 

We do not want to keep track of changes for the built files since they are generated from the source files. It's redundant and makes it less clear where someone should update content. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Git helps us with this with the .gitignore

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "_build/" >> .gitignore
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we check with git status

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main", "type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

only the gitingore file itself is listed! just as we want. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
now that's the only new file as far as git is concerned, so we will track this, 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and finally commit
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'ignore built site'

## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub?


Right now, we do not have any remotes, so if we try to push it will fail. Next we will see how to fix that. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First let's confirm 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: No configured push destination.
Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

    git remote add <name> <url>

and then push using the remote name

    git push <name>

```
and it tells us how to fix it.  This is why inspection is so powerful in 
developer tools, that is where we developers give one another hints. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Right now, we do not have any remotes

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main":"type":"redaction"}

For today, we will create an empty github repo shared with me, by accepting the assignment linked in prismia or ask a TA/instructor if you are making up class.

More generally, you can [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we add the remote
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote add origin https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm.git
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then we can try to push



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

```

we get an error, becuse we need to link the branch locally to a remote branch

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
To https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

now we get an error because the remote and local have different commits

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We follow the instruction again, and pull
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> main

```

we see the fetch part works, but then the linking fails


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We need to tell it how to link on pull

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull origin main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per

fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```
and we get an error about how they have different histories. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we tell it how we want it to resolve that 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull origin main --rebase
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD

```
and success!

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and now we can actually push
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push --set-upstream origin main
```
