Create a file `gitcommandsbreakdown.md` and for each command in the template below break down what steps it must do based on what we have learned so far about git objects.  I started the first one as an example based on what we discussed today, fill in the others.  In class on Thursday, we will make a commit using plumbing commands, so thinking about what you already know about commits will prepare you to learn this material. 

```
# What git commands do

## `git status`

- check the branch of the HEAD pointer
- compare the HEAD pointer to the FETCH_HEAD, if different trace back through parent commits to find out how many commits apart they are and which is ahead (or if both ahead and behind)
- compare the snapshot at the HEAD pointer's commit to the current working directory
- if staging is not empty, compare that to the working directory

## `git commit`

- 

## `git add`

- 
```
