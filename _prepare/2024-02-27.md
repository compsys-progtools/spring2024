1. review the notes on [what is a commit](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2024/notes/2024-02-08.html). In {index}`gitdef.md` on the branch for this issue, try to describe git in the four ways we described a commit.  **the point here is to think about what you know for git and practice remembering it, not "get the right answer"; this is prepare work, we only check that it is complete, not correct**
2. Start recording notes on _how_ you use IDEs for the next couple of weeks using the template file below. We will come back to these notes in class later, but it is best to record over a time period instead of trying to remember at that time. Store your notes in your kwl repo in {index}`idethoughts.md` on an `ide_prep` branch. **This is prep for after spring break, it does not go in the Feb 27 experience branch; keep this branch open until it is specifically asked for**
