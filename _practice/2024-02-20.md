1. Describe a type of project where it would be worth it for you to learn a language you have never used before in {index}`newlanguage.md` This should be based in what types of features for the language your project would require and/or what would contribute to the long term health of the project.
2. Learn about one of the following languages that you have not used before: [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) or another language you are curious about that appeared in the Developer survey. For example you might be interest in the [top paying languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-top-paying-technologies). Use the official documentation.  Answer the following questions in {index}`languagelearning.md`:

    ```
    1. What is this language designed for?
    2. What Programming paradigm(s) does it support?
    3. Give at least 1 example of a programming language that experience in would make it **easy** to learn this language and explain why. 
    4. Give at least 1 example of a programming language that experience in would make it **hard** to learn this language and explain why. 
    5. What is its most unique feature(s)?
    ```

hint: for questions 3 & 4, for example learning Python first does not make it easy to learn C++, but learning C makes it very easy to learn C++. 

## Explore badge option 

Actually try out one of the langauges above in a new repo created from [this asssignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/ENi8xpR_). 

**work on a branch and commit after each step**

1. Setup the devcontainer to provide the compiler/interpreter for the language of your choice. See [features](https://containers.dev/features)
2. Add top extensions related to the language to the devcontainer. 
3. Add a [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) file for that language
4. Write a hello world type program in the language and make sure it runs. 
5. Use the official documentation to figure out a common task in the language and write an example program that completes something typical for that language (eg a sort data analysis in R). You may use GitHub Co-pilot in the code space to help write the code.  
6. Test your understanding of the code by trying to modify it. 
7. Fill in the prompts in the README (follow the comments)
8. Answer the questions in the README of the template repo.
