*this is integrative-2*
1. Create `in_five_years.md` and answer the following two questions: What do you think you will remember from this class in five years? What parts of this course's content do you think will change the most in five years?
1. Reflect on how this course impacts programming/debugging skills in `skillup.md`.  You can write this as how you think your own skill has improved **or** as if you are convincing another student to take this class. Touch on at least *three* topics.
2. Submit a PR with either [advice to future students on how to succeed in the course](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/spring2024/blob/main/resources/testimonials.md) or [on why a student should take this course](https://github.com/compsys-progtoolsc/introcompsys.github.io/blob/main/fromstudents.md). Each of those is linked to where you should add your advice.
