1. Explore the [tools for conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits) and then pick one to try out. Use one of the tools that helps making conventional commits (eg in VSCode or a CLI for it)for a series of commits adding "features" and "bug fixes" telling the story of a code project in a file called {index}`commit-story.md`.  For each edit, add short phrases like 'new feature 1', or 'next bug fix' to the single file each time, but use conventional commits for each commit. In total make at least 5 different types of changes (types per conventional commits standard) including 2 breaking changes and at least 10 total commits to the file.  
2.  [learn about options for how git can display commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).  Try out a few different options.  Choose two, write them both to a file, {index}`gitlog-compare.md`. Using a text editor, wrap each log with three backticks to make them "code blocks"  and then add text to the file describing a use case where that format in particular would be helpful. **do this after the above so that your git log examples include your conventional commits**
