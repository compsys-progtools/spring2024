1. Read about different workflows in git and add responses to the below in a {index}`workflows.md` in your kwl repo. Two good places to read from are [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#ch05-distributed-git) and the [atlassian Docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
2. Update your kwl chart with what you have learned or new questions in the want to know column
3. Find the hash of the blob object that contains the content of your {index}`workflows.md` file and put that in the comment of your badge PR for this badge.

## Workflow Reflection

1. Why is it important that git can be used with different workflows?
1. Which workflow do you think you would like to work with best and why?
1. Describe a scenario that might make it better for the whole team to use a workflow other than the one you prefer.
