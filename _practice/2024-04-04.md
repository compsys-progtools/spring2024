1. Write a C program to compare values as doubles and as float (single precision/32bit) to see that this comparison issue is related to the IEEE standard and is not language specific.  Make notes and comparison around its behavior and include the program in a code cell in  {index}`cdouble.md`
2. In {index}`floatexpt.md` design an experiment using the `fractions.Fraction` class in Python that shows helps illustrate why `.1*3 == .3` evaluates to `False` but `.1*4 ==.4` evaluates to `True`. Your file must include both code and interpretation of the results.
