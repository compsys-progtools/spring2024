# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

The best way to be sucessful in this course is to be on top of your work. I know that sounds obvious and you should apply it to every class but for this class especially it matters a lot because what I struggled with was not really realizing I had work to do because it never felt like I did and I was so preoccupied with my other couses that I started feeling more and more behind. 
Also this class in my opinion is a class thats more important than any calculus class you will take because you actually need to understand how to use github since it is so prevalent in companies today. 

This class teaches very important skills for the higher level computer science classes and beyond. In order to succeed in this class staying on top of the assignments (badges) is important. It is easy to fall behind because the badges do not have hard due dates but they are easy to complete if you do them close to the class they relate too. Additionally you should not be afraid to get help. You can work on a badge until you get stuck and then submit what you have to get advice on it, or go to office hours.
