# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

The best way to be sucessful in this course is to be on top of your work. I know that sounds obvious and you should apply it to every class but for this class especially it matters a lot because what I struggled with was not really realizing I had work to do because it never felt like I did and I was so preoccupied with my other couses that I started feeling more and more behind. 
Also this class in my opinion is a class thats more important than any calculus class you will take because you actually need to understand how to use github since it is so prevalent in companies today.
