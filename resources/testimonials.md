# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students
The best way to be sucessful in this course is to be on top of your work. I know that sounds obvious and you should apply it to every class but for this class especially it matters a lot because what I struggled with was not really realizing I had work to do because it never felt like I did and I was so preoccupied with my other couses that I started feeling more and more behind. 
Also this class in my opinion is a class thats more important than any calculus class you will take because you actually need to understand how to use github since it is so prevalent in companies today. 

It's important that you become familiar with git/github in the beginning of the semester, because this will help you learn how the grading structure works and how to submit assignments. Once you do that, take some time to read and understand the grading structure because it can seem complicated to new students. This was something that I struggled with in the beginning
of the semester, especially with learning github for the first time. Another thing that is important is to stay on top of badges because they can pile up, and you don't want to rush to finish them at the end of the semester. Overall, if you are able to stay diligent with submitting badges and become familiar with the course structure, you should have no problem
exceling in this course!
