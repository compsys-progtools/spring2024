# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

From my experience making sure to attending all the classes and labs was by far the most important part of my learning in the class. The speed of the classes were
almost always just right for me and Dr. Brow is always open to hearing suggestions for the pacing. The hands on learning style was also what helped me develop a much 
stronger understanding for many of the topics we covered. The second most important thing to do in this class is to communicate with the teacher and TA's. They are all
very understanding people who want to help you succeed in this class.
