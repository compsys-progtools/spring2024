# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

In my opinion, there are a few things you should know in order to help you succeed. Make sure to start all of your work early, this will help you throughout the semester. Also, make your plan early in the first few weeks to figure out which grade you want to achieve. If you understand the content in class, you will develop all the skills necesary to succeed in the class. Also, office hours are very useful for when you get stuck with anything.
