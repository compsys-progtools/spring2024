# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students
- Try to do Practice/Review Badges earlier. They sometimes build on each other, and will make work easier in the future. They also build on things that we have learned in class, so it would be easy to start the badge while the knowledge is fresh.
- Take time to play around with the tools used in class. This will help you understand how those tools work a bit better.
