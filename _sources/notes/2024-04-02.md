# What happens when we run code?


```{important}
We reviewed the [solution to updating your assigmnment action](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/kwl-sp24-brownsarahm/commit/16f0baaaf3f23e6210b527ffc137fd2b8a4d202f)

## Starting the CPU Emulator

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Linux/MacOS

In your terminal:
```bash
cd nand2tetris/tools
```

and then 
```bash
bash CPUEmulator.sh 
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Windows

```bash
CPUEmulator.bat
```

or in file explorer, Double click on the `CPUEmulator.bat` file


:::

::::



and it will open  a new window

For more on how the emulator works see the [CPU Emulator Tutorial](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_24b3a15aa628404fbf6dacd86d7da3af.pdf).

For much more detail about how this all works [chapter 4](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_d70026d8c1424487a451eaba3e372132.pdf) of the related text book has description of the machine code and assembly language.

## Loading a program

We're not going to *do* project 5, which is to build a CPU, but instead to use the test programs designed to check if your personally build CPU works with the CPU Emulator they provide to *understand* a simple canonical CPU.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We're going to use the test cases from the book's project 5:

1. Load Program
2. Navigate to `nand2tetris/projects/05`

## How does the computer actually add constants?

We'll use `add.hack` first.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This program adds constants, 2+3.  

It is a program, assembly code that we are loading to the simulator's ROM, which is memory that gets read only by the CPU.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Run the simulator and watch what each line of the program does.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice the following:
- to compute with a constant, that number only exists in ROM in the instructions
- to write a value to memory the address register first has to be pointed to what where in the memory the value will go, then the value can be sent there



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The simulator has a few key parts:
- address register the `A`
- program counter the `PC`
- the ALU
- the D register



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If you prefer to read, see [section 5.2.1- 5.2.6 of nan2tetris book](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_b2cad2eea33847869b86c541683551a7.pdf)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

- This program the first instruction puts 2 in the address register from the instructions in ROM.  
- Then it moves the 2 through the ALU to the data register (D)
- then it puts 3 on the address register
- then it adds the numbers at D and A
- then it puts 0 on the address register
- then it write the output from the ALU (D) to memory (at the location indicated by the A register)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## The max between two numbers

To compute the maximum value `max.hack`:
- subtracts  the two numbers
- compares the difference to 0
- jumps to different lines based on if it is >0 or not
- assigns the address regiter a value accordingly
- copies one of the two values to the new location

## File Permissions

First, we will go back to seawulf
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ssh -i ~/seawulf brownsarahm@seawulf.uri.edu
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Last login: Thu Mar 28 12:33:16 2024 from 172.20.126.231
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
First lets make a file:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ nano hello.sh
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
with a simple script in it
```bash
echo "hello!"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we want to run the file, we can use `bash` directly,
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ bash hello.sh 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello!
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

this is limited relative to calling our script in other ways.


One thing we could do is to run the script using `./`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ ./hello.sh
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
-bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

By default, files have different types of permissions: read, write, and execute for different users that can access them. To view the permissions, we can use the `-l` option of `ls`.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ ls -la
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For each file we get 10 characters in the first column that describe the permissions.  The 3rd column is the username of the owner, the fourth is the group, then size date revised and the file name.

We are most interested in the 10 character permissions. The fist column indicates if any are directories with a `d` or a `-` for files. We have no directories, but we can create one to see this.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see in the bold line, that the first character is a d.

The next nine characters indicate permission to **R**ead, **W**rite, and e**X**ecute a file. With either the letter or a `-` for permissions not granted, they appear in three groups of three, three characters each for owner, group, anyone with access.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 we moved the file to make the permissions list shorter
```{code-cell} bash

[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ cd compilec/

here we can compare files we were able to run (the ones we built on this system) 
and see they have the `x` permission. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To add execute permission, we can use `chmod`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf compilec]$ chmod +x hello.sh
[brownsarahm@seawulf compilec]$ ls -l
```

-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392   474 Mar 28 13:14 help.c
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392  3040 Mar 28 13:19 help.o

-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392     5 Mar 28 13:33 name.txt
```

now we have x permission on the `hello.sh` and we can run it!

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Is there a way to do assembly like whats done on CPU emulator through a bash terminal? Is it more difficult to do so? Is there a better way to do so?

Assembly is not interpreted, so it cannto be run interactively, and it has to be assembled to objet code and linked to run on your base computer.  


### Are there pratical uses for CPU emulator besides being used for testing and understanding?

This CPU emulator is designed for learning.  More complex hardware emulators can be developed for other devices and then are used for testing software on other devices.

### Will we look at some low level languages?

The `hack` assembly we saw is one!  However, learning more about other assembly languges is a good explore

### what does JGT stand for?

Jumpt if greater than


### Is ram dedicated to display located on the GPU?

Yes, in a system with a GPU (our emulator is a super simple computer witthout that) there is memory on the GPU with dedicated storage for what to display. 


### Is there a way to make .sh files automatic have X permissions? 

Not that I am aware of, but you can always run it with `bash`

### Are there any useful applications of making your own assembly language?

It could be more efficient, or it could be needed due to new hardware functionality.  It could also be useful for teaching. 

### What is an emulator used for?

An emulator allows you to see what a device does without having to have that actual device.  In the case of the CPUEmulator we used today, it allows us to simulate runnign code on a simpler compute to get the basic ideas. 


### What are the exact three categories of users for file permissions?

owner, group, world/any


### What does ASM stand for?

Assembly


### Does the CPU use Assembly?

It uses the object representation, not the assembly representation, but the assembly matches the operations the CPU can do.  It is just easier for us to read assembly than object (binary).


### What other components are in a CPU that are like a ALU?

The other components are not super like an ALU, but the counter is the most similar. 


### where is this information useful?

Understanding how your code runs can help debug and it can help you optmize.  You will see more about that in CSC411, in this course our goal is to get you ready for that class. 

### Why does it make me give myself permissions for a bash script if I'm the one who created it?

This is a good explore. 

### Are there any restrictions on changing specific restrictions on certain files ?

Only the file permissions.
