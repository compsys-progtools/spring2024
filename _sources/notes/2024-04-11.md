# What *is* a computer?

++{"lesson_part": "main"}

- how, physically, do we get the components we have seen?
- what other components do we need?
- how are those implemented




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
How have computers changed over time?

- at the physical level
- what was the context and motivation for these advances?
- how does that context influence how we use computers today?
- how does that influence computing as a discipline?

## Let's start with a dictionary



[we can start with a dictionary](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/computer_n?tab=meaning_and_use)

- note that this starts with reference to a person.




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
### Computers as people

 and this text this particular dictionary is useful because it also includes where does the term originated like where does in that particular usage start appearing and so these are these are pretty all right this is starting 1646 1707

- Use of the word computer to refer to the person still common how recently  1950s
- the movie [hidden figures](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/) is available on Disney+ with subscription or other streaming platforms for ~$4 streaming rental.
- the book [hidden figures](https://uri-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/10nopmq/01URI_ALMA21128298920002396) is available at URI's library





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Computers as Machines

Computers as machines started later. We started with mechanical, analog and then moved to electronic and then digital.

### How much do we talk about computers?

[how much do we talk about them changes over time ](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=on&content=computer&direct_url=t4%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMPUTER%3B%2Cc0#t4%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMPUTER%3B%2Cc0)

## Mechanical Calculators
 how do we actually like physically make it be machine


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

 well we've we've talked we handed out that like it's going to reduce down to or isn't my check and logical operations write those de back much further than

He was 18 and  his father was a tax commissioner in France and he wanted to like reduce his father's workload

 so he invented this calulator machine and received royal privilege from France in 1649 to be only person allowed to build a manufactured Computing a calculator is like mechanical calculators

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Contrast this royal privelege with the 1970s where in resolving some other conflict, a court that declared the content of the computer cannot be copyrighted and it's free for anyone to use the concept of a computer


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

##  How did this change over time?



calculators that are still analog so they're still working with mechanical systems using Waze electricity becomes easier

### So how do these thigns actually work

- [We can build an adder mechanically with marbles and wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDshWmhF4A)

As electricity became more available, they realized that in terms of mathematical operations, electrical components resemble springs and switches
 
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

## Early Computers


- first vaccuum tubes: or diodes
- diodes prevent flow of electricity in one direction and allow in the other. they can be used to create circuits that behave like the logical operations, and create the gates.
- diodes only are easy for `&` and `|` gates,
- transistors can operate as a switch or amplifier and can also be used to build logic gates
- they're faster, smaller, and better at more types of gates than diodes

## Storage


- there are some thigns we have not yet seen in detail in that diagram
- Ram Is Random Access we can access it whenever we want we can read and write to
- ROM: is read only memory; the instructions are Permanently



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
In the stored program computers, the programs were in ROM.

The very earliest computers could not store any values without power.
