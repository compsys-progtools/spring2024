1. Make a table in {index}`gitplumbingreview.md` in your KWL repo that relates the two types of git commands we have seen: plubming and porcelain. The table should have two columns, one for each type of command (plubming and porcelain).  Each row should have one git porcelain command and at least one of the corresponding git plumbing command(s). Include two rows: `add` and `commit`.
