1. Try a new IDE and make some notes about how it was to learn in {index}`newide.md`  What is easy? hard?  What could you apply from the ones you already use?  Were there features you had trouble finding? 
2. Add at least one comment on others' posts on the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/introcompsys/discussion-fa23-community/discussions/categories/ide-class) about IDEs.
