1.  Export your git log for your KWL main branch to a file called {index}`gitlog.txt` and commit that as exported to the branch for this issue. **note that you will need to work between two branchse to make this happen**. Append a blank line,  `## Commands`, and another blank line to the file, then the command history used for this exercise to the end of the file. 
2.  In {index}`commit-def.md` compare two of the four ways we described a commit today in class. How do the two descriptions differ? How does defining it in different ways help add up to improve your understanding?
