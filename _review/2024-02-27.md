1. Read about different workflows in git and describe which one you prefer to work with and why in {index}`favorite_git_workflow.md` in your kwl repo. Two good places to read from are [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#ch05-distributed-git) and the [atlassian Docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
2. Update your kwl chart with what you have learned or new questions in the want to know column
3. In {index}`commit_contents.md`, redirect the content of your most recent commit, its tree, and the  contents of each tree and blob in that tree to the same file. Edit the file or use `echo` to put markdown headings between the different objects. Add a title `# Complete Commit` to the file and at the bottom of the file add `## Reflection` subheading with some notes on how, if at all this excercise helps you understand what a commit is.
