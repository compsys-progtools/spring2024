1. Pick a component that is in the more detailed von Neumann (other than the ALU) and contribute an explanation of what it is to your group repo. Coordinate with your team so that each contribution is a different component by creating an issue stating what you will work on before contributing. Link to your PR in the group repo in your badge PR. All contributions should include a description of the component- what it does and how it is built- and it's predecessors.  All must include sources as markdown links. 
2. review a classmate's PR providing feedback and either approving or requesting changes
3. Work with your group mates to ensure both your PR and the one you reviewed get approved and merged.
